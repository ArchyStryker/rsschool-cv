#### About me
    I served for a long time on a contract basis in the army. But the desire 
    to learn new things makes set ourselves interesting tasks. Two years ago 
    I became interested in programming languages and information technology 
    in general. I see the front-end as a great start, but I don't plan on 
    dwelling on it.

#### My skils
    Knowledge: HTML, CSS (Flex, Grid), JS;
    Weak knowledge: NodeJS, MySQL, PHP, C++;

#### Example code
    ``` JS
    let lenght = prompt ('enter password length','');
    let charset = ('1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM1234567890');
    let test = generatePassword(lenght, charset);
    function generatePassword(length, charset) {
        let password = '';
        for (let i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            password += charset [Math.floor (Math.random () * charset.length)]
        }
        return password;
    }
    alert (test);
    ```
