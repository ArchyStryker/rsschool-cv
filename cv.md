#### About me
  I served for a long time on a contract basis in the army. But the desire 
  to learn new things makes set ourselves interesting tasks. Two years ago 
  I became interested in programming languages and information technology 
  in general. I see the front-end as a great start, but I don't plan on 
  dwelling on it.

#### My skils
  Knowledge: HTML, CSS (Flex, Grid), JS;
  Weak knowledge: NodeJS, MySQL, PHP, C++;

#### Example code
  ``` JS
  let lenght = prompt ('enter password length','');
  let charset = ('1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM1234567890');
  let test = generatePassword(lenght, charset);
  function generatePassword(length, charset) {
      let password = '';
      for (let i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
          password += charset [Math.floor (Math.random () * charset.length)]
      }
      return password;
  }
  alert (test);
  ```
